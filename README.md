# CCUpdaterUI

## Summary

Project under construction!

Yes, that includes the lack of a COPYING file.

I'll get around to fixing it around the time CCUpdaterCLI gets a license, since this is going to depend on that.

## Actual Summary (In future)

Mod install/update UI.

## Dependencies

Measurements specified by Material Design are used for consistency with the CCDirectLink website under the understanding that these measurements are part of a design language. No code from other Material Design implementations is used, in favour of a ninepatch-based approach with code where necessary to implement transitions and other animated features.

As for other dependencies: Oh, this is going to take a while...
